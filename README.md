# news-analyser-collab
A group can log in, receive a DB table's worth of news data (from 3rd party), and make analyses together on this web app.

## TODO
- database tables for news articles from 3rd party, cases (outputs based on a handful of articles), notes (related to articles), article tags, users
- login functionality (probably SSO)
- UI to show articles and tag them
- UI to create cases and pull in related articles
- optional: code for exporting cases (PDF? HTML?)
- optional: code for importing more 3rd party news data (from JSON? CSV?)
